### Getting started

Correctly predict the tomorrow's best performing crypto and win!
This is a port of my other project, [Coin Price Bet](https://github.com/vbstreetz/coin-price-bet) that uses Band/Cosmos instead of Chainlink/Ethereum.

Frontend at https://crypto-bet.netlify.app.

- Uses DAI for collateral (obtain test DAI via [compound finance](https://app.compound.finance/asset/) app).
- Currently available on the Rinkeby testnet.
- Periodically polls chainlink oracle to determine the best performing crypto of a particular day.
